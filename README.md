Decoupling and Optimal Control of Semi-explicit Semi-linear PDAEs of Index 2
-------
Jan Heiland (TU Berlin)


We consider optimal control problems constrained by semi-linear, semi-explicit, partial differential-
algebraic equations as, e.g., the Navier-Stokes equations. Assuming a slightly increased reg-
ularity, one can find a decoupling into the differential and algebraic variables that reveals
necessary and sufficient conditions for the unique solvability of the state equations. These
results carry over to the adjoint - with respect to the cost functional - equations. Under stan-
dard assumptions on existence of a unique local solution, we prove a uniform bound on the
inverse of the Frechet-differential of the local optimality conditions. This result implies lo-
cal convergence of Newton schemes applied to the nonlinear optimal control problem. The
work presented differs from the extensive literature on optimal control of the evolution Navier-
Stokes equation in so far as it does not resort to divergence-free spaces.
